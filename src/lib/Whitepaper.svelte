	<h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-semibold">What is Comet?</h3>
	<p class="mb-6">
		Meme money for ordinary people. $COMET was created in response to stagnation in the memecoin
		ecosystem. It doesn't implement any technical nor economic ready-to-use ideas to add value but
		uses the known advantages of blockchain systems. This token was created to provide light-hearted
		fun for everyone and bring more people into the Ergo ecosystem.
	</p>

	<h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-semibold">The objective</h3>
	<img src={tokenomicsImage} alt="tokenomics" class="mb-6 w-full" />

	<h4 class="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">
		Since only 2 of the founding members took a small portion of their founding tokens and the rest
		3 gave them away, this is a small update of the tokenomics
	</h4>
	<img src={tokenomicsV2Image} alt="tokenomicsV2" class="mb-6 w-full" />

	<p class="mb-6">
		The objective is to expand the $COMET token as far and wide as possible, use it on tipbots, make
		it available on every DEX and CEX possible, use it for NFTs and every other blockchain
		application imaginable. In the early stages of the token the 5 founding Cometeers will guide the
		process, but they will gradually pass the responsibility to the community and then disappear
		like my father when he went to buy cigarettes.
	</p>

	<h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-semibold">Treasury funds</h3>
	<p class="mb-6">
		Treasury funds could be used to pay for ads, burning, providing liquidity to Dexes. Whatever the
		community decides, there is only one requirement that should be always respected. Every amount
		spent on promoting/developing $COMET should also be used to promote Ergo, either directly or
		through the Ergo Foundation.
	</p>

	<h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-semibold">Exchange liquidity:</h3>
	<p class="mb-4">
		The liquidity pair for $COMET/$ERG will come 100% from the presale, there are plans to bring
		more funds to it so the slippage allows smooth swapping. Initially the refundable ICO will have
		an allocation of 42.069% of the total supply.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		But there is a high chance that not all of it gets bought, that's why we will provide staking
		and mining of $COMET emission schedule.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		<strong>Mining 50% of the non sold ICO:</strong> This emission will follow ERG emission schedule
		(EIP 0027) and will be set up with GetBlok so miners get $COMET on top of their $ERG rewards. We
		think this is the fairest method of distribution and also incentivizes miners to have their own wallets
		instead of setting up an exchange wallet.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Staking 50% of the non sold ICO:</strong> This emission will follow ErgoPad emission schedule,
		because we will either copy their code or use Paideia to build a DAO with $COMET as the governance
		token. *Add founder locking to the roadmap, we need to ask Blasen for it lol. I have the contracts
		if he wants.
